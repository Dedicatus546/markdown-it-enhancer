import { Url } from "./url";

//
// Changes from joyent/node:
//
// 1. No leading slash in paths,
//    e.g. in `url.parse('http://foo?bar')` pathname is ``, not `/`
//
// 2. Backslashes are not replaced with slashes,
//    so `http:\\example.org\` is treated like a relative path
//
// 3. Trailing colon is treated like a part of the path,
//    i.e. in `http://example.org:foo` pathname is `:foo`
//
// 4. Nothing is URL-encoded in the resulting object,
//    (in joyent/node some chars in auth and paths are encoded)
//
// 5. `url.parse()` does not have `parseQueryString` argument
//
// 6. Removed extraneous result properties: `host`, `path`, `query`, etc.,
//    which can be constructed using other parts of the url.
//
